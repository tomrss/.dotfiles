Configuration files for common programs, with special emphasis on GNU Emacs.

** Manage symlinks with GNU Stow

Using GNU Stow, you can easily create symlinks to get started right away without having to manually creating them or to copy files to configuration folders.

Stow a package (create symlinks for configuration files of one program):
#+begin_src bash
stow <package>
#+end_src

Get started right away stowing every package:
#+begin_src bash
./initialize.sh
#+end_src
When launching this script, you can control which package will be stowed by editing the =packages.txt= file.
